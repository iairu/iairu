For my bachelor's thesis, I defended Find-A-Cat, a program for pedigree management with a breeding algorithm. On a team project, I implemented CI/CD for automatic deployment of a custom NocoDB extension on PowerPC, coincidentally and helped others with Docker issues including documentation. For web development, I prefer Svelte. In my master's thesis, I'm trying to implement a software digital twin honeypot. For organization, OneNote and Apple Calendar app connected to Google account work well for me, but I always adapt to team needs. As a daily driver, I have macOS on a Thinkpad X260 alongside my other Apple devices (not a typo :D). For development, I currently use VSCode. In the meantime, I've extensively used Notion, Zed, ArchLinux, FreeBSD, Obsidian, etc. Besides studies and computer science, I enjoy translating Japanese songs, anime, cats, hiking, cooking and photography.

Currently looking for a job in Bratislava, depending on circumstances and team needs in areas of frontend, CI/CD, Docker, documentation, Ansible, support and similar. Open to ideas.
